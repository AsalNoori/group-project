    <h2>Why Was Demolition Considered?</h2>
    <p>Despite its charm and strong reputation, the Exmouth View Hotel was beginning to show its age. Though it had once been a grand example of seaside accommodation, it retained a somewhat dated appearance. Originally constructed from two adjoining Victorian houses that had been merged into a single structure and later expanded, the hotel bore a distinctive 1970s aesthetic. While many guests were drawn to its warm hospitality and stunning location, a handful of visitors noted that the interiors and facilities were in need of modernization. Some reviews mentioned tired decor, outdated furnishings, and areas of wear and tear that hinted at the building's long history.
    </p>
    <p> Operating a hotel of its size and stature was no small financial undertaking, and maintaining such a large and aging property required significant investment. Furthermore, the hotel occupied a generous plot of land in a highly desirable area where demand for housing was steadily increasing. What made the site particularly valuable, however, were the spectacular views from the rear of the property, overlooking the serene beauty of the surrounding coastline. Given these factors, it was perhaps inevitable that redevelopment would be considered.
    </p>
    <p>By 2019, plans were put forward to transform the site entirely, replacing the long-standing hotel with modern residential housing. A proposal was submitted to demolish the Exmouth View Hotel and construct 12 contemporary apartments along with two stylish townhouses, designed to take full advantage of the prime location. After thorough discussion, Torbay Council's Development Management Committee reviewed the application, weighing the benefits of increased housing supply against the loss of a well-loved local landmark. Ultimately, the proposal was approved, marking the end of an era for the Exmouth View Hotel and paving the way for a new chapter in the site's history.</p>

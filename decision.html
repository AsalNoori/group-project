<h2>What Was The Planning Department's Decision?</h2>
<p>All factors were carefully weighed, and it was ultimately concluded that the removal of the outdated and aesthetically unremarkable building, in favor of a thoughtfully designed development, would be an overall benefit to the area rather than a loss. While some lamented the disappearance of another hotel in a well-visited tourist region, supporters of the redevelopment argued that the Exmouth View Hotel was neither an architectural landmark nor an essential part of the area's hospitality sector. Given the growing demand for housing, particularly in a desirable coastal location like Babbacombe, the introduction of modern residential properties was seen as a practical and necessary step forward.</p>
<p>The plans were approved with several conditions to ensure the new development would be in keeping with the character of the neighborhood. Strict guidelines were put in place regarding the design and materials to be used, ensuring that the finished buildings would be of high quality and visually complementary to their surroundings. Additionally, measures were introduced to mitigate the impact of construction on local residents. These included an agreed schedule for the works, limitations on noise levels, and dust control measures to minimize disruption.</p>
<p>Although there was some regret over the loss of a hotel, particularly in an area that thrived on tourism, it was acknowledged that the Exmouth View Hotel had struggled to compete with more modern accommodations. The economic and practical realities of maintaining such an establishment had become increasingly challenging, making its transition into residential use a more sustainable long-term solution. Ultimately, the decision reflected a balance between preserving the town’s character and addressing the pressing need for more housing, ensuring that the site would continue to serve the community in a new and valuable way.</p>
